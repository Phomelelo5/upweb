            Receive my most humblest of greetings to all personage who would gaze upon my portfolio. Welcome, I am <span>Mkh</span>atshwa
            Phomelelo. I acquired a bachelor's de<span>gree</span> <span>In com</span>munication studies. 
            My current interest <span>lies in</span> network and infrastructure. I am an easy-going guy, humble and fun to be around.
            I like music, mostly rap, I can write lyrics and record them too. I love watching animes, and I am a fast learner.
            I am a very patient person, I'm accomodative, making friends is like shooting fish in a barrel, but I don't like judgy people.
            I hope I don't die young from my curiosity, heard it killed a Cat, I am curious about many things, I want to know many things
            Unfortunately, even in the longest life, there is no enough time to learn it all so I will pick what I can while I can. 
            I got a disability growing up, I didn't struggle much dealing with it, whatever happens to you was waiting to happen 
            from the beginning of time. That is my belief and what helps me overcome hardships and embrace happy moments.
